Learning to COUNT
What if you want to count the number of employees in your employees table? The COUNT statement lets you do this by returning the number of rows in one or more columns.

For example, this code gives the number of rows in the people table:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM people;
How many records are contained in the reviews table?
